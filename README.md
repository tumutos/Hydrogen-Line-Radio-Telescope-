This repository contains my work on detecting and processing the 21 cm hydrogen line (1.42 GHz) using a home-built radio telescope. The system was constructed from a TV satellite dish, which is normally designed for C- or Ka-band signals and therefore not ideal for hydrogen line observations, so I do not recommend this hardware for serious experiments; however, it served as a useful learning platform. For reception I used a HackRF One, and I experimented with three different data acquisition methods. My first attempt was simply recording raw samples through the GQRX data-saving mode, but this approach quickly proved impractical due to the lack of preprocessing options and the extremely large file sizes. I then tried capturing data directly through HackRF Python libraries, which gave me more control, but Python alone was not efficient enough for long observations and real-time filtering, both of which are necessary to improve SNR. The final and most effective method was using GNU Radio for preprocessing and data collection, as its block-based structure made it easy to implement filtering and long-duration acquisition. In this workflow, GNU Radio performs the initial filtering and recording, and the exported data is then post-processed in Python. The repository is therefore organized into two main parts: preprocessing scripts that interface with HackRF and GNU Radio, and post-processing scripts that apply filtering, integration, and spectral analysis to extract the hydrogen line.
